                <p>A commisioned project for an unreleased online game. Set in an old mining town in the far reaches of alaska, this map has well balanced gameplay and a high level of detail. A collaboration with fellow artist Octodoodle, it features many unique areas including a mineshaft, sawmill, sleeping quarters, and many buildings throughout the town. The project is well optimized, and required many skills to create such as terrain creation, modelling, texturing, and general knowledge of level design and environment art.</p>

                <p>An unfinished collaboration which was planned to span many worlds and push the limits of browser games. Even though it was never finished, much work was still put into it, including modelling and texturing several spacecraft, as well as making a few planets with custom terrain and assets. We developed a chunk system to help with performance, as well as many menus and interactions from scratch.  </p>
